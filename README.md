## üöÄ Key Results & Strategic Deliverable

The model determined the most robust fit for the stationary ICT Investment data is **$\text{ARIMA}(1, 1, 0)$**.

### Model Performance (Validation)

| Metric | Result | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ARIMA Order** | $\mathbf{(1, 1, 0)}$ | Investment change is highly dependent on the **previous quarter's change** ($\mathbf{d=1, p=1}$). |
| **RMSE** | **$12.34 \text{ Billion}$** | On average, the quarterly prediction error is **\$12.34 Billion**. |

### Final Executive Summary (Actionable Insight)

> The forecast shows moderate long-term growth for U.S. ICT Investment but highlights **significant volatility** with a wide $95\%$ Confidence Interval in outer years.
>
> **Primary Recommendation:** Companies must adopt a **Cautious Expansion Strategy**. Investment priority should be placed on **flexible, high-margin software platforms** (OpEx) over fixed hardware infrastructure (CapEx) to mitigate the high downside risk identified in the forecast.
